Piccadilly wants its system to:
- [ ] Track all of its **customers** and any relevant customer information, such as customer ID, name, username/login details, delivery address(es), phone number(s), payment methods on file (e.g., cash, credit, check - if credit, then the card number should also be stored), etc.
- [ ] Track each customer's pizza **preferences**
- [ ] Track the **ingredients** that comprise each of these preferences (e.g., onions, ham, pineapple, anchovies, bacon, etc.)
- [ ] Support an interface for each of its delivery **drivers**, tracking the addresses each driver delivers to, the dates/times of delivery, and money collected (including tips)
- [ ] Track standard **drinks**, including a product ID, drink description, manufacturer, supplier, price
- [ ] Support calculating the proper sales tax (the pizza joint located at the intersection of the four corners of the US, so you might have to support sales taxes for Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah)
- [ ] Track its **pizza** sizes (small, medium, large, extra large), types (thick or thin crust), **ingredients** (pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, onions, cheese, etc.), price data for these pizza sizes and ingredients, and happy hour price discounts.
- [ ] Maintain a history of **transactions** - all purchases including price, payment method, and delivery date.
